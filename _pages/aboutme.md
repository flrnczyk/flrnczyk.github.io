<p align="justify">
  I had been passionate about language(s) since very young, but I did not know much about linguistics as a serious science until I took Grammatical Analysis (Intro to Syntax), a course that engrossingly changed my ways of viewing language(s). I then decided to orient my academic pursuit toward becoming a linguist.

  In my spare time, I like also to watch films/series 🎬, citywalk 🚶🏻 and enjoy alcohol 🍺.
